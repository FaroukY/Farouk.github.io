  Hi, my name's Farouk and I'm a Quant Trader at Citadel LLC. I enjoy thinking about recreational math and combinatorial optimization problems. In my free time, I enjoy creating [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqTBrQYYUcc&ab_channel=ForAllEpsilon) videos about problem solving. I am also actively involved in several research projects.
